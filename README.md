## 📍 About the Space
We’re breaking in a new DIY venue built for sonic exploration:  
- **15x26 ft. professionally sound-treated room**  
- **Tuned by Jalipaz** (of Audioconfusion)  
- **Used for therapy by day—sonic ritual by night**  
- **Outdoor patio available for chilling + vaping**

This isn’t just a venue. It’s a listening chamber. A holding space.  
**We respect volume. We respect each other.**
